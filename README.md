## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties.
- Mobile-first workflow
- And JavaScript for further functionality.

 <br>

### What I learned

This project let me review many CSS properties that I was not aware of, and also put emphasis in the importance of developing with a Mobile-first workflow.

<br>

### Continued development

It needs to have a function added to the email error. This function will limit the type of input for the email field (check regex).

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Check the mozilla CSS guide.
- [How to Fix the “Cannot read property ‘addEventListener’ of null” Error in JavaScript](https://codingbeautydev.com/blog/javascript-cannot-read-property-addeventlistener-of-null/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand why I was getting this error, and find the proper solution. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
